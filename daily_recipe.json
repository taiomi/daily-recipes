        "instructions": "Begin by melting the butter with the oil in a large Dutch oven.  Brown your beef well on all sides.\nOnce all sides are browned, drain off any excess fat in pan (more than a tsp.) and add 1 qt. of stock to pot.  Bring to boil, then reduce to simmer.  Cover pan and simmer gently for until meat is fork tender, ~2 1\/2 hours.\nWhen beef is finished, transfer it to a large bowl with any juices and let cool until able to handle, then shred it.\nIn the same pot you cooked the beef in, add the bacon and cook just done.  Remove bacon, but leave fat in pan.\nAdd veggies and cook until just beginning to soften.\nAdd shredded beef and reserved bacon back to pot along with herbs.\nAdd 2 qts. stock (or more to just cover) and simmer over medium-low heat until vegetables are tender, ~10 minutes or so.\nI let it sit, covered for at least an hour to allow the flavors to come together.  Remove herb stems and bay leaves.  Season with freshly cracked black pepper (and salt if needed, depends on the saltiness of the liquid you used, so taste first).\nTo serve, drizzle with a glug of balsamic vinegar and grate some fresh parmesan over the top.  Sprinkle with fresh, chopped herbs and more black pepper, if desired.",

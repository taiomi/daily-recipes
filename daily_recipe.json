The tuna will start to turn white almost immediately, a sign that it is cooking from the acidity of the lime juice. It is not necessary to cook the tuna. In fact, it is best served immediately while it is melt-in-your-mouth tender and moist.<\/li><li>Serve immediately by mounding atop crackers, chips, micro-greens, or even roasted sweet potato slices.<\/li><\/ol>",

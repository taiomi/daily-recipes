        "instructions": "Prepare an ice bath. Trim the bottom tip off the broccolini. Bring a large pot of water to a rolling boil. Add a generous amount of salt. Blanch the broccolini for 30 seconds, remove, then submerge into the ice bath. When the broccolini is fully cooled, drain and pat dry with a kitchen towel.\nReduce the balsamic vinegar over medium heat until it becomes 1\/4 cup of sticky syrup. Set aside.\nDrop a small handful of basil leaves into the oil. Shield yourself from potential splatter. It only takes one second for the leaves to pop. Immediately fish them from the oil with a strainer and place onto a towel-lined plate. The leaves should become crisp and translucent, but not darkened or it will be bitter.\nHeat up the grill and coat generously with olive oil. Grill the broccolini until slightly charred and softened. Season with salt and pepper.\nWrap the broccolini with prosciutto. Place onto serving platter, drizzle with some extra virgin olive oil and the balsamic reduction.\nGarnish with basil crisps when ready to serve.",

Drizzle each with sesame oil, sprinkle with sesame seeds. Top with gochujang (red pepper paste) or Sriracha sauce as substitute.<\/li><li>*Bibimbab and its main ingredients (usually rice and vegetables) can be chosen at one's preference. This is the main reason why bibimbab is so appealing; it suits vegetarians, dieters, health-conscience eaters, and even meat-lovers, who are more than welcome to add beef to their liking. For us, since we usually have rice available to eat at all times, we simply slice up any available vegetables or lettuce leaf varieties in the fridge for an \"instant\" and very satisfying bibimbab meal. So feel free to deviate from the original recipe!<\/li><\/ol>",

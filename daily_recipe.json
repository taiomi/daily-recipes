        "instructions": "CHOUX PASTRY\nPreheat oven to 180C. Line a baking tray with parchment or a baking mat.\nCombine water, milk, butter, sugar and salt in a saucepan and bring to a boil over medium heat.\nStir in flour quickly and cook over low heat, stirring constantly until mixture pulls away from sides of pan cleanly and forms a ball.\nTransfer dough into a mixing bowl and using an electric mixer, beat on low speed to cool slightly, about 3 mins.\nAdd eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition.\nCover bowl with plastic wrap and chill for at least 30 mins in the fridge. Dough may be stored, covered, for up to 24 hours in the fridge.\nRemove dough from fridge and fill into a piping bag.\nFrom this point on, you can pipe into rounds using a nozzle of your choice or cut a hole of about  1 1\/2 cm at the tip of the piping bag and pipe into little logs of about 5 cm in length.... or longer if you want a bigger eclair.\nBake in preheated oven for about 20 - 25 mins or until golden brown.\nRemove from oven and using the tip of a small knife (I used a chopstick), pierce a small hole to allow the steam to escape. This prevents the eclairs from going soggy on the inside. You can also do this step and place it into the oven for another 2 mins to dry it out.\nAllow to cool on a rack.\nPASTRY CREAM\nPlace all ingredients into a saucepan and whisk until evenly combined.\nPlace saucepan over medium heat and bring to a slow boil, stirring continuously.\nWhen mixture thickens into a paste, remove from heat. Transfer pastry cream into a clean, dry bowl and cover with plastic wrap to prevent a skin from forming. Allow to cool and then place in fridge until fully chilled.\nNote: pastry cream will thicken slightly when chilled. Use within 2 days.\nWhen chilled, fill pastry cream into piping bag fitted with a tube nozzle and fill eclairs through the hole\/slit you have made earlier.\nDip or drizzle the top of filled eclairs with chocolate ganache.\nSprinkle with powdered sugar if desired.\nGANACHE\nHeat cream over medium heat in a saucepan until just about boiling. Do not boil.\nRemove from heat.\nMix in chocolate pieces and stir until all chocolate has melted. Leave to cool.\n(Ganache will thicken when cooled).\nCan be kept in fridge. Remove and stand container in a bowl of warm water to soften before re-using.",

        "instructions": "<ol><li>Peel off thigh skins with a paring knife. Trim off excess fat. Cut into one single \"steak\" piece working around the bone. Save smaller pieces for cooking as well. Set aside in a large mixing bowl.<\/li><li>Pulse the marinade ingredients in a food processor until smooth.<\/li><li>Coat the chicken pieces with the marinade. Marinate overnight in the refrigerator or a minimum of 6-12 hours. With a skewer or toothpick, piercing the thighs for extra marinade absorption is optional.<\/li><li>Preheat a skillet or non stick pan over medium heat. Add the chicken thighs and cook for about 15-20 minutes or until cooked through. To ensure fully cooked thighs, use a meat thermometer and check for a reading of 165-170F.<\/li><li>Transfer to a serving plate and garnish with scallion. Serve with lettuce leaves. Enjoy!<\/li><\/ol>",

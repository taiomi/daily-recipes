        "instructions": "<ol><li>Soak cedar plank in water for 2 hours.  Rinse salmon under cold water and pat dry with paper towels.  Place a medium sauce pan over medium high heat and add bourbon or brandy.  Use caution as the alcohol can ignite; never pour directly from the bottle.   When alcohol is reduced and there is only a small amount left, add apple juice, brown sugar, and garlic.  Continue to cook over medium high heat until reduced to about  of the original volume (should be slightly thinner than syrup).<\/li><li>Season salmon with salt and pepper on both sides, brush skin side with olive oil and place on cedar plank, skin side down.

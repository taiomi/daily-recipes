        "instructions": "<ol><li>Prep everything beforehand. Dice the trinity (onion, celery, bell pepper), mince garlic, season shrimp with salt and pepper, etc.<\/li><li>In a medium-heated heavy pot or dutch oven, fry sliced sausage with a little olive oil and set aside.<\/li><li>In the same pot, add butter and about 1\/4 cup of olive oil. When butter melts, quickly whisk in flour until fully incorporated. Using a wooden spatula, stir continuously (to prevent flour from scorching) until roux is brown, about 10 minutes.<\/li><li>Add trinity and garlic to the mix and cook for another 5 minutes or so. Make sure the roux doesn't stick to the bottom of the pan, so add more oil if you need to.<\/li><li>Now, add the stock to deglaze the pot for a couple of minutes. Then, sprinkle in the Cajun seasoning mix and bring to a boil. Let reduce uncovered, still in medium heat, for about 40 minutes or until liquid reaches a gravy-like consistency.<\/li><li>In the end, stir in the sausage slices and raw shrimp for a couple more minutes. When it returns to boil, turn off heat and re-season accordingly. Let simmer for another 5 minutes before serving.<\/li><li>To serve, plate a bed of rice and smother with etouffee. Garnish liberally with parsley and scallions.<\/li><\/ol>",

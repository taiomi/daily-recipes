        "instructions": "<ol><li>(*) To blanch almonds, dip almonds into boiling water for 1 minute. Remove the brown skin covering. Dry in a 200 F oven for 30-45 minutes, stirring occasionally. Use a food processor to chop them to the finest size possible. (A 2-pound bag of almonds is what you'll need for this recipe).<\/li><li>Preheat oven to 300 F. Combine all of the ingredients thoroughly. Form into desired shapes and sizes (we usually form them into crescents) and bake on greased and floured cookie sheets. Bake for 20-30 minutes depending on thickness of cookie. (In my oven, it takes about 24 minutes).<\/li><li>NOTES :This recipe is a double recipe. These are one of my favorite cookies-I just LOVE almonds!<\/li><\/ol>",

        "instructions": "1. Heat the oil in a large (12 inch) nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the ground beef, onion, chili powder, cumin, cayenne and 1\/2 t. salt. Cook, breaking up meat into small pieces, until it looses all the pink color, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds or so.\n2. Add brown sugar, tomato sauce, water and macaroni. Bring to a boil. Cover and cook, stirring often and adjusting the heat so that it maintains a lively simmer (somewhere between medium\/medium-high heat), until the macaroni is tender, about 10 minutes or so. Season with salt & pepper if needed.\n3. Off heat, stir in half the cheese. Sprinkle the remaining cheese on top.",

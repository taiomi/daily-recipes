        "instructions": "Place onions in slow cooker. (I used half of a red onion and half of white because I had them and they needed to be used)\nPlace roast on top of onions.\nSeason meat with salt and pepper.\nIn a small bowl whisk together broth, vinegar, tomato paste, tapioca, garlic and Italian seasoning.\nPour mixture over meat.\nSet cooker on low and cook for 8-10 hours. If youre short on time set cooker to high and cook 4-5 hours.\nLet cook without disturbing or checking on it; Every time you open the lid it lets all that precious hot air out. I was bummed to come home and find that my lid somehow and fallen in and created a constant leak. But it all worked out just fine in the end.\nOnce roast is cooked and is tender to the point of falling apart transfer to serving dish.\nUse juice and onions in crockpot as gravy. Transfer liquid to a gravy boat.\nPlate it up\nENJOY!!!",

        "instructions": "<ol><li>First thing of action: bake your tofu. Preheat the oven to 350F. Let tofu sit on a kitchen towel for 15 minutes, turning once, to absorb moisture. Cut tofu into 1 inch cubes. Brush them lightly with vegetable oil (I always use olive oil, but I am certain that this recipe would be best with a peanut oil). Place them on a baking sheet and bake for 35 minutes, turning once.<\/li><li>In a small pan, heat butter and garlic on low until the butter has just almost melted. Add the apples, tofu, and salt. Bring heat up to medium, and cook for about 4 minutes. At this point you should add the water and stir every minute for the next 6-7 additional minutes, or until there is little moisture left in the pan. Turn off the heat, and add the brown sugar. Stir to incorporate all of the sugar. Place on top of salad lettuce.<\/li><\/ol>",

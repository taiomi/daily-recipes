        "instructions": "Heat the fat in a 6-quart enameled Dutch oven over medium high heat and brown the ribs on all sides.  Pour in the stock; add water to cover if necessary.  Add the vegetable scraps and bring to a boil.  Lower the heat to a simmer, cover and cook for 45 minutes to an hour, or until the ribs are tender.\nWhile the ribs are braising, saute the onions over medium-low heat in a large cast iron skillet until soft; add the garlic and saute for another minute more.  Stir in tomato sauce, vinegar, honey, pepper or hot sauce, cayenne pepper, chili chili powder, salt and dry mustard. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer, uncovered for 25 minutes, stirring occasionally.\nWhen the ribs are tender, remove them from the braising liquid and add them to the spicy tomato sauce in the pan.  Raise the heat and cook, stirring frequently, until the sauce has glazed the ribs, about 10 minutes.  Serve with the remaining sauce on the side, if desired.",

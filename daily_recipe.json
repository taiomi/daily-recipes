        "instructions": "Step 1: Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Melt the butter and add the celeryand onion to a medium pot and saute over medium heat for about 8 minutes.Step 2: Stir in 2\/3 cup flour, salt and pepper, celery seed, onion powder, garlic powder, and Italian seasoning. Slowly whisk in the chicken broth and milk, stirring constantly until the the mixture begins to thicken and then simmer lightly until thickened. Remove from heat and mix with the drained vegetables and turkey.Step 3: Fill two pie crusts with your turkey and vegetable mixture. Carefully top each pie with another pie crust, pinching the sides together. Cut several small slits into the top of the pie crust to allow the pies to vent while cooking.Step 4: Bake uncovered in the preheated oven until the pies are golden brown, about 30 minutes. If the tops of the pies are browning too quickly, place a sheet of foil over the pie crusts and continue to bake. Cool for about 10 minutes before serving.This has to be one of the most delicious pot pie recipes I have ever tasted! What a great way to use up that leftover turkey. Another great substitution for turkey would also be to use a Rotisserie chicken. MMmmmm. I will be trying that soon.Have you ever tried a pot pie recipe? What about a Turkey Pot Pie Recipe?

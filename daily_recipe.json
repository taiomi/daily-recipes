        "instructions": "Yes, these are called SPICY hot wings for a reason. I like adding the brown sugar to give them a little sweeter taste, but it is by far a delicious spicy recipe more than anything.To get started, mix the brown sugar, crushed garlic, hot sauce, and cayenne pepper into a medium mixing bowl. Mix well and then set aside.Take the cooking spray and spray the entire inside portion of the slow cooker AND also the wings. (Spraying the wings before you grill, bake, or cook chicken keeps the flavor and makes them super juicy. TRUST ME.)Take the wings and add them into the mixing bowl with your spices and toss to get a good even coat over the wings.Place in the slow cooker on low for 4 hours. After 4hours, remove carefully and place on a prepared cookie sheet. Place in the oven under broiler setting for 4-6 minutes, allowing the wings to get a little crisp.Serve immediately with a little blue cheese dressing and celery.",

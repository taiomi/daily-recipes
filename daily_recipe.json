        "instructions": "<ol><li>Using the side of a rolling pin or a meat tenderiser, gently beat the pork until flattened to a 0.5cm thickness.<\/li><li>Sprinkle the seasoned flour onto a plate. Beat the eggs in a bowl. Mix the breadcrumbs with the grated parmesan and sprinkle the mixture onto another plate.<\/li><li>Dredge each escalope lightly in the flour on both sides, shaking off any excess, then dip into the egg, then press into the breadcrumb mixture, to coat on both sides. Chill in the fridge for 20 minutes before cooking.<\/li><li>Heat the oil in a frying pan over a medium heat and fry the schnitzels for 2-3 minutes on each side, or until golden-brown on both sides and completely cooked through (there should be no trace of pink in the middle). Remove from the pan and set aside to drain on kitchen paper.<\/li><li>For the sauce, pour the wine into a small saucepan, add the tarragon sprig and bring to the boil. Continue to boil for 1-2 minutes, or until the volume of liquid has almost completely reduced.<\/li><li>Pour in the stock and return the mixture to the boil. Boil for 3-4 minutes, or until reduced in volume by half, then add the cream and simmer for 2-3 minutes until thickened. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper, then stir in the chopped tarragon.<\/li><li>To serve, place one pork schnitzel onto each of two plates and spoon over the sauce. Garnish with wedges of lemon and serve with your choice of vegetables on the side.<\/li><\/ol>",

        "instructions": "<ol><li>We'll start out by making the dough for our ravioli. Add to a food processor all of your ravioli ingredients.<\/li><li>Run the processor and mix the ingredients up well. If the dough looks like pebbles, it's a touch too dry. Add about 1\/2-1 tsp of water and mix again. It should form a nice ball of dough. Once your dough is mixed, bring it out of the processor and knead it for a few minutes.<\/li><li>Cover your ball of pasta dough with plastic wrap and let it rest for a good twenty minutes.<\/li><li>While your dough is resting, let's whip up the tasty filling. Grab your skillet and heat up the butter on medium heat. Now add in the garlic.<\/li><li>Next we'll add in the proscuitto, onions and mushrooms.<\/li><li>Let it cook up for a minute or two and then add in the salt and oregano. Give it a swirl or two around the pan to mix in and then add in your spinach.<\/li><li>Let the spinach wilt down completely and then remove the mixture from the heat.<\/li><li>Now it's time to grab your well rested pasta dough and pop out some ravioli.<\/li><li>Rip off about a sixth of the ball and run it through your pasta maker (or hand roll it) to the desired thinness.<\/li><li>If you have a ravioli cutter you can use that, or you can use a glass to cut circles, or you can do like we did and use a cookie cutter to make fun shapes celebrating the holiday.<\/li><li>After you have your ravioli cut out, you'll drop a good teaspoonful of the prosciutto mixture into the center of the pasta.<\/li><li>Brush the edges with an egg wash (the egg white from one egg) and place another pasta piece over the top. Seal the edges with your fingers, a fork, or whatever puts a smile on your face.<\/li><li>Grab a pot, fill it up with water and set it to boil. The pasta will cook up quick (it will float when cooked)<\/li><li>Grab another pan, drop the butter into it and cook it on medium until it turns a beautiful golden brown and gives off a lovely nutty smell. At this point you'll turn the heat down just a notch and add in your garlic.<\/li><li>Now drop in your chopped basil, give it a swirl or two to let the basil wilt and your butter sauce is ready to rumble.<\/li><li>Drain your cooked up ravioli, dump them in the butter sauce and get them good and coated.<\/li><li>Serve them up with a little grated Parmesan or Romano over the top.<\/li><\/ol>",

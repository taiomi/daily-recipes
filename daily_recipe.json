        "instructions": "<ol><li>Heat up the grapeseed oil in a saucepan over high heat until the oil is shimmery and hot, but not smoking.<\/li><li>Add the green onions, ginger, garlic and shallots at once, but be careful, the oil will bubble and splatter. The onions will sizzle and wilt almost immediately and turn a bright green.<\/li><li>Take the pan off the heat and stir the sauce with a wooden spoon. Add the fish sauce, sesame seed oil, rice wine vinegar, soy sauce, honey, crushed red chile pepper and salt to taste.<\/li><li>Let sit for 15 minutes, then toss with your favorite noodles.  I used fresh Chinese egg noodles.<\/li><\/ol>",

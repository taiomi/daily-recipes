        "instructions": "Soak dried navy beans overnight in a large pot. You want the water to be cold and about 2-3 inches above the beans. Cover and refrigerate at least 8 hours.\nDrain and rinse the beans. Place in a large pot and cover by 4-5 inches of fresh water. Bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer for 1  1 hours until the beans are tender but not bursting.\nIn the meantime, combine teriyaki sauce, soy sauce, pineapple juice, brown sugar and ginger in a medium bowl. Whisk until brown sugar has dissolved. Set aside.\nPreheat oven to 350\nReserving 2 cups of the boiled water, drain the beans.\nIn a large Dutch oven, saut bacon for 3-4 minutes over medium high heat. With a slotted spoon remove bacon and set aside.\nAdd onions to the bacon fat and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and pineapple and saut for an additional minute, until the garlic becomes fragrant.\nPlace bacon back into the dutch oven and add the cubed ham steak, beans, reserved water, and prepared sauce. Stir well to combine.\nBake in the oven covered for 10 minutes. Reduce heat to 200 and continue to cook for 6 hours, stirring halfway through.\nAfter 6 hours, remove lid, increase heat to 350 and cook for an additional 1-2 hours stirring every twenty minutes until the sauce has thickened.",

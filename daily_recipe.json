        "instructions": "<ol><li>Heat the oil in a very large pan that has a close fitting lid.  Then add the celery, bacon, onion, carrot and garlic.  Fry this off for about 5 to 7 minutes until it has softened a little.  No colour is needed on the vegetables, so make sure the heat isnt too high that they become brown, but high enough the vegetables sweat and soften.<\/li><li>Add the tomato pure and  the thyme leaves, stir through and cook for about 30 seconds.<\/li><li>3.Add the stock, the tin of tomatoes, fresh tomatoes, and a little salt and pepper. Stir everything through, set the heat so that your soup is on a gentle simmer, cover and cook for about 25 minutes or until the vegetables are cooked al dente.<\/li><li>Add the pasta and cook until the pasta is ready.  Follow the timing instructions on the packet, but this is normally about 7 minutes.<\/li><li>Add the cabbage and the beans and cook until the cabbage has wilted.  This will take about 5 minutes.<\/li><li>Check for seasoning and add some salt and pepper if needed before serving.<\/li><li>Sprinkle a little parmesan over each bowl of soup.<\/li><\/ol>",
